```

Once installed, you can launch the app anytime by simply typing:

```


## Features

- Real-time pipeline status visualization
- Integration with CI/CD API
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- Routing with TanStack Router
- Server state management with TanStack Query

## Release Strategy

ReleaseHub follows a **Trunk-Based Development** model with **Tag-based promotion**:

- **Staging**: Automatically deploys the latest commits from the `main` branch.
- **Production**: Deploys are triggered manually by creating a **GitHub Tag**, promoting a validated version from Staging to Production.

The app leverages the **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** to perform these operations remotely, ensuring it remains stateless and can manage multiple repositories without local clones.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React 19 + Vite (Rolldown)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **Router:** TanStack Router
- **Data Fetching:** TanStack Query + Axios
- **Icons:** Lucide React

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated
- jq (JSON processor)
